# Musi Public License project

This project aims on providing a free and open source software license that
is localizable and internationalizable.

There is an existing localizable free license, Creative Commons, but that
does not quite fit the use of free software. While there are multiple free
software licenses, few of them are localizable.

## How we do it

We do so by introducing additional clauses allowing localized versions of
the license able to substitute each other, while retaining all its original
open license properties.

To be precise, we used 3-clause BSD license as an basis, and extend it to a
point that it allows such substitution. The 3-clause BSD is simple enough
to understand and translate.

In order not to cause any trouble on license copyright, the original licnese
is reworded before use.

## How can I participate

Currently we have only English and Chinese (Simplified) versions.
Translators are highly needed! Also you can provide us the legal knowledge
that we somehow lacked. We, for now, are mostly programmers that want to
distribute our free software across boundaries of cultures.

Feel free to fork this repository, and send pull requests to us.
